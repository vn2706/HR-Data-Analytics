# **HR Data Analytics Dashboard**

This project demonstrates the development of a comprehensive **HR analytics dashboard** designed to analyze workforce data and provide actionable insights for better decision-making. By combining **SQL** for data cleaning and transformation with **Power BI** for visualization, the project showcases the ability to extract meaningful trends and patterns from raw **HR datasets** using **MS SQL Server** and **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.

## **Objectives**
The project aims to derive actionable insights into workforce dynamics by analyzing:
- **Retention Trends**: Average employee tenure and reasons for termination.
- **Satisfaction Levels**: Engagement and satisfaction scores across departments.
- **Hiring Patterns**: Salary trends and demographics of new hires.
- **Absence Metrics**: Employee absence rates and their impact.
- **Diversity Metrics**: Gender, marital status, and geographic distribution.
